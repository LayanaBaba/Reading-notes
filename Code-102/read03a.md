# HTML 
HTML uses tags to give the information they surround special meaning.
There are three main parts :
* Body: <body> </body>
* Head: <head> </head>
* Title: <title> </title>

DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using. The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. The new elements provide learer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements). Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
