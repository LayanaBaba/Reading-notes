CHAPTER 15: LAYOUT

* BUILDING BLOCKS:

1- BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS: Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout.
2- INLINE ELEMENTS: Inline boxes flow between surrounding text.  


* NORMAL FLOW:

1- position:static 
You can use this property to indicate the elements should appear in normal flow.

2- position:relative
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

3- position:absolute
When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

4- position:fixed
It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. I

* FLOATING ELEMENTS:

float: this property can be used tp place the element left or right.

* The optimum size of pages within 960-1000 pixels wide.
