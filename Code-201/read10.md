**From the Duckett JS book:**

*CHAPTER 10: ERROR HANDLING & DEBUGGING*

* THE STACK:

The JavaScript interpreter processes one line code at a time. When statement needs data from another function, it stacks the new function on top of the current task.If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At the point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code. 

* HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS:
You can  two things with the errors:

1- Debug the Script to fix errors.
2- Handle errors gracefully.

The console is a helpful things, it can define the area in which the error is located. In JavaScript there is seven types of error objects.
