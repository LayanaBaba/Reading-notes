# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

*From the Duckett HTML book:* 

CHAPTER 2: TEXT

- HEADINGS: < h1 > , < h2 > , .... , < h6 >
HTML has 6 levels of heading from h1 up to h6. The main header is h1. You can control the size of text, color, and fonts using CSS.

- PARAGRAPHS: < p >
To create a paragraph, use the opening tag < p > and the closing tag </ p >.

- BOLD & ITALIC: 
By surrounding words in the tags < b > and </ b >, we can make characters appear bold. And by surrounding words in the tags < i > and </ i >, we can make characters appear italic.
 
- LINE BREAKERS & HORIZONAL RULES:
* < br/>: To add a line break inside the paragraph.
* < hr/>: you can add horizonal rule between sections.

- STRONG: < strong>
To indicate that the content has strong importance.

- QUOTATIONS:
There are two elements used for making quotations:
* < blockquote>: is used for longer quotes.
* < q>: is used for shorter quotes.

CHAPTER 10: INTRODUCING CSS
A CSS rule contains two main parts: a selector and a declaration. Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to, and declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Also, CSS declarations is made of two parts: a property and a value. Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change,  Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.

 
*From the Duckett JS book:*

CHAPTER 2: BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS

- COMMENTS:
* /* you can write comments in more than one line, and these comments don't appear on the web page. */
* // you can write comments in one line only.

Variables are used to store data.

- DATA TYPES:
There are three data type in JavaScript: 
* Numeric data type: 1, 2, 5.5.
* String data type: Any thing inside a pair of quotes.
* Boolean data type: this type of value can have one of two values: true or false.


CHAPTER 4: DECISIONS & LOOPS

- COMPARISON OPERATORS: EVALUATING CONDITIONS:
 
Is equal to (==): This operator checks two values to see if they are the same.
Strict equal to (===): This operator checks two values and their data type to see if they are the same.
Is not equal to (!=): This operator checks two values to see if they aren't the same.
Script nt equal to (!==): This operator checks two values and their data type to see if they aren't the same.
 
- STRUCTURING COMPARISON OPERATORS: 

Greater than (>): this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
Less than (<): this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
Greater than or equal (>=): this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right.
Less than or equal (<=): this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right.

- LOGICAL OPERATORS:

Logical AND (&&): this operator tests more than one condition.
Logical OR (||): this operator tests at least one condition.
Logical NOT (!): this operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.

- IF STATEMENTS:
the if statement checks a condition, if the condition is true, the code block are excused.

 
*COMMIT MESSAGE:*
Commit message is very important, and its an explanation of why we made the changes. We can add the commit inside the double quotes of [ git commit -m"" ].
