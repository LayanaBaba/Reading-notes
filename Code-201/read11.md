* CONTROLLING SIZES OF IMAGES IN CSS:
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.

* ALIGNING IMAGES USYING CSS:
You can use the float property to move the element to the left or the right.

* BACKGROUND IMAGES:
You can use the background-image property to place an image behind any HTML element. Inside the curly braces in CSS you can use background-image: url ("the relative path of the image");.
The background image is repeated horizontally and vertically by default. You can use repeat-x to make the image repeated horizontally only, repeat-y the image is repeated vertically only, and no-repeat this image is shown once. 
You can use background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.
