**From the Duckett HTML book:**

*CHAPTER 7: FORMS*

* HOW FORMS WORK:

1- A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
2- The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
3- The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
4- The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

* FORM STRUCTURE:
< form >: Form controls live inside a < form > element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too. 

Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.


*CHAPTER 14: LISTS, TABLES AND FORMS*

* BULLET POINT STYLES:
The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point (also known as a marker). It can be used on rules that apply to the < ol >, < ul >, and < li > elements.

* IMAGES FOR BULLETS:  
You can use list-style-image property to specify an image to act as a bullet point.
 

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.


**From the Duckett JS book:**

*CHAPTER 6: EVENTS*

Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
