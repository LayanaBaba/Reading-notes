CHAPTER 15: LAYOUT

KEY CONCEPTS IN POSITIONING ELEMENTS


* BUILDING BLOCKS:
- BLOCk-LEVEL ELEMENTS: Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout.
- INLINE ELEMENTS: Inline boxes flow between surrounding text.


CONTROLLING THE POSITION OF ELEMENTS

* Normal Flow: Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. 
* Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
