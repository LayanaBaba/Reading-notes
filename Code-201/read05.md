From the Duckett HTML book:

**CHAPTER 5: IMAGES**
 
* ADDING IMAGES:
To add image into the page you need to use the self closing tag < img src="" alt="">, in src you must add the URL of the image, and on alt attribute you must type the description of the image.
 
* HEIGHT & WIDTH OF IMAGES:
To control the height and width of image you must add the tow attributes, < height=""> and < width="">.
 
* WHERE TO PLACE IMAGES IN YOUR CODE:
You can put image before a paragraph, inside the start of a paragraph and in the middle of a paragraph.

* ALIGHNING IMAGES HORIZONTALLY:
The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. The align attribute can take these horizontal values: left and right.

* HTML5: FIGURE AND FIGURE CAPTION
- < figure>: Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new < figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. 
- < figcaption>: The < figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.


**CHAPTER 11: COLOR**

* FOREGROUND COLOR:
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
- REG VALUES
- HEX CODES
- COLOR NAMES

* BACKGROUND COLOR:
You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names . 


* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


**CHAPTER 12: TEXT**

In CSS, you can control the font, size, weight, and style. You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented. You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.




There are three used image formats in websites, JPEG, PNG, and GIF. JPEG images are best suited for photographs and paintings of natural scenes where the variations in color and intensity are smooth. a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG. GIF images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations.
