From the Duckett JS book:

CHAPTER 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 

CHAPTER 4: Decisions and Loops

* IF STATEMENTS:
The if statement checks a condition, if the condition is true, the code will run.
if (first condition){Do this code if the first condition is true} else if (second condition){do this code if the second condition is true} else{do this codifies all conditions are false}.

* SWITCH STATEMENT: 
This expression is evaluated once. And it allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes.

* LOOP:
Loops check a condition, it repeats until the condition returns false. The types of loops:

-For: if you need to run code a specific number of times.

-While : if you don't know how many times the code should run. A for loop uses a counter as a condition. The condition consists of three statements, initialization [create a variable set it to 0. (var i = 0;)], condition [ the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specific number (i< x;)], and update [ it adds one to the counter (i++)].
