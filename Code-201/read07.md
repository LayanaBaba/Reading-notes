**DOMAIN MODELING**
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

There are some steps you can follow it when you want to write out and test your codes:
* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

CHAPTER 6: TABLES

* BASIC TABLES STRUCTIRE:
You can create a table by using the < table > element, this element have < tr > and < td > contents, the < tr > stands for table row, and the < td > stands for table data. Also, there are < th > element which it used to represent the heading for either the column or row.

* LONG TABLES:
There are three elements for this part: < thead > this element controls the headings, < tbody > the body should sit inside this element, < tfoot > the footer belogs inside this element.

CHAPTER 3: FUNCTIONS, METHODS, AND OBJECTS

* CREATING AN OBJECT:
You can create an object by name = {} .The curly braces make an empty object. You can make an object inside another one.

* ARRAY ARE OBJECTS:
Array is a special type of object.

* CREATING AN INSTANCE OF THE DATE OBJECT:
You can use it when you want to work with dates. And to create it you can follow this: var today = new Date();
