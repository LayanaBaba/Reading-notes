**Component-Based Architecture**

> A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

*There are three different views of a component:*
- Object-oriented view.
- Conventional view.
- Process-related view.

*The characteristics of components are reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated , and independent.*

- **Reusability:** Components can be reused in different situations in different applications.
- **Replaceable:** Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
- **Not context specific:** Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- **Extensible:** A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

**The advantages** of using component based architecture are ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, odification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent.

**What is Props and How to Use it in React**

Props is a special word in react, which stands for properties. And props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components. 

There are three steps to use props:

- Define an attribute and its value(data).
- Pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
- Render the Props Data.

Props can only be used in an uni-directional flow (from parent to child).

**React Tutorial through ‘Passing Data Through Props**

React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Components are a small pieces of code.

JSX is a special syntax, most react developers use it.

ReactDOM.render() is used to render a React element into a root DOM node.

renderSquare method, change the code to pass a prop called value to the Square.
