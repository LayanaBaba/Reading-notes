| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                                                | Non-relational or distributed database.                                |
| Table based databases                                                                       | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.|
| Have predefined schema                                                                      | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data.                             |
| Vertically scalable                                                                         | Horizontally scalable.                                                 |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | Queries are focused on collection of documents.                        |


**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.


**Give a real world example.**

Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application


**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.


**Give a real world example.**

Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.


**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL. 


**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

SQL.


## sql vs nosql 

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language.

**What is a realational database?**

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables

**What is a ‘schema’?**

A schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.

**How does it work?**

The simplest type to describe is the document database, in which it would be natural to combine both the basic information and the customer information in one JSON document.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Every mongod instance has its own local database, which stores data used in the replication process, and other instance-specific data. The local database is invisible to replication: collections in the local database are not replicated.


**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
MongoDB, because it enables them to build applications faster, handle highly diverse data types, and manage applications more efficiently at scale.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Less mature and Less support.
