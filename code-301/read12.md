**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**


|             SGL                                                                             |                 NoSQL                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                                                | Non-relational or distributed database.                                |
| Table based databases                                                                       | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.|
| Have predefined schema                                                                      | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data.                             |
| Vertically scalable                                                                         | Horizontally scalable.                                                 |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | Queries are focused on collection of documents.                        |


**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.


**Give a real world example.**

Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application


**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.


**Give a real world example.**

Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.


**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL. 


**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

SQL.
