## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team**

Julia Rozovsky wanted to find a job that was more social. In 2009, She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.

>There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups.
>It wasn’t like that for me.
Rozovsky said.

She started looking for a new group, she could join it.

The team chose a plane for a micro­gym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines.

Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked.

Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as ‘‘group norms’’, as they struggled to figure out what made a team successful.

Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

In 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees.

The technology industry is increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

The protocol is used to get pages from servers to your browser, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.
