**React lifecycle**

* 1- The render happens first.
* 2- Mounting phase (constructor).
* 3- From first to final: constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, and componentWillUnmount.
* 4- componentDidMount() is used to connect to the YouTube API and get videos when the components is rendered.

**React State Vs Props**

* 1- React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component.Â 
* 2- Props: handle outside a component and uppdate outside a compnent.
     State: handle inside a component and uppdate inside a compnent.
* 3- when the state is used.
* 4- Counter and Forms are some examples of things that we could store in state.
