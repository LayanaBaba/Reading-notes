##  The code I'm still ashamed of

  * "The code I'm still ashamed of" is an article has been created by ***Bill Sourour***, about his experience of writing a code for pharmaceutical company that was  drugs. He was bored of reading the quiz that had to make for that company that pushed a certain drug to young women and girls, until the drug caused a suicide, and then he found out that the drug unfortunately caused severe depression. Somehow he blames himself for helping to promote that drug because he helped to build the website that promoted it, and wishes he had never taken part in building that website. The author of this felt that he is responsible,  but think he shouldn't blame himself so much because he wasn't the one who made the drug or was in charge of promoting it. He didn't know anything about the drug, and should of looked into what he was helping to advertise before creating the quiz, but he was just starting out working there, and he had to do the code depends on the  requirements . I do agree with him about the fact that when it comes to coding its best to follow the code of ethics, only code what is  beneficial to people, and does not advertise things that are potentially harmful to others. I would make sure to look into products effects, and make sure whatever it is I am just  helping the users to get a benefits .
